# I think this project deserves a 4+ because...
# Unaware of the extension I spent every free moment working on this coding during thanks giving
# And hontestly the end result was not what I had planned at the beginning but it turned out 10 times better than I imagined
# A lot of the code I use I learnt on the way while coding the game, which is why there's so many surprises
# For example, more than half the code in here I wouldn't have know were possible or exists if it weren't for my curiosity to
# search it up.
#
#Features Added and reasoning together:
#Added a twist to the triditional hangman, when the user guesses a correct letter they gain back a life and the
#hang man animation will lose a body part. (while I'm writting this I realized gaining body parts for losing makes no sense
#I changed it so they lost a body part if they guess wrong and gain back one if they are correct...makes more sense.
# ^ I didn't like an 'actual' hanging man, so I changed it to a strawberry plant
#Played around with unicode so I didn't need to type out every letter.
#Added an AI for the user to compete with (if these brackets are here I may have forgot to edit this and I have not
# been able to add an AI -> if the case ignore this feature)
#Made a custom screen for every gameState and helped a few other friends make a custom main screen too
# I edited a few of the sprites, like the hangman guy who use to have a frown now has a smile, and some candy (on lose screen)

#I made sure to add a function description for everything, even if I wasn't sure it needed one. Because I lost
#all my marks there last time.
#Learnt by width and height are in caps in the progress
#Learnt that I could set color names with a certain color code as a variable, and added a few to my game
#Made the discorvery of centering text and rectangles, makes life easy.

#I didn't add a quit game button so they user can never leave, 200IQ
#I added I bunch of sounds and music to match certain events, and a buttoned click sound because who doesn't
#like clicky buttons. and it turns out adding sound and images is sooo simple... I've spent half a day searching it up to no
#sucess...because I had an error with thonny or pgzero. Waste of time but atleast I know how to fix it next time.

#overall very proud of this, even got my family to play it. Now off to the emerging technologies assignment
